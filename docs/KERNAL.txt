KERNAL POWER UP ACTIVITIES*

1) KERNAL checks for the presence of ROM at $A000

The KERNAL looks in memory at $A000 for the AUTO START
ROM SEQUENCE, if this sequence is present, control is
transferred to the ROM program.
If this AUTO START ROM code is not present normal system
initialization continues.


2) RAM test

The RAM TEST routine first clears memory from $0000-$00FF
and from $0200-$03FF. The cassette buffer pointer is initialized to
$033C.

The RAM test starts at location $0400 and works upward,
checking for the first byte of RAM memory (start-of-RAM). If this
location is greater than $1000, then memory is considered bad and
an error screen is shown.

Once the test has found the start of RAM it continues, checking
upward for the first non-RAM location (top-of-RAM). If this location
is <$2000, then memory is considered bad and an error screen is
shown.

If the top-of-RAM location is greater or equal to $2100, then the
screen is set to start at $1000, the bottom-of-memory is set to
$1200, and the top-of-memory is set to the top-of-RAM location.

If the top-of-RAM location is less than $2100, then the screen is
set to start at $1E00, the bottom-of-memory is set to start-of-RAM,
and the top-of-memory is set to $1E00.


3) Other Activities

I/O vectors are set to default values.

The indirect jump table in low memory is established.

The GETCHAR routine is created on page zero.

The screen is then cleared, and the 'BYTES FREE' power up
message is displayed. Control of the system is turned over to
BASIC and the user.
